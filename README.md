# BorderCheck

**Finds the open doors on your work laptop and tells you how to close them.**

One stolen password or one bad download can let someone onto a laptop. How much damage they do next depends
on what was left open. BorderCheck looks for:

- programs that accept connections from other machines
- API keys and passwords saved as plain text
- SSH keys with no passphrase
- tunnels, remote access and AI agents that skip approvals

For each one it finds, it says how to fix it. It runs on macOS, Windows and Linux and needs no admin rights.
A plain run only reads: it changes nothing and sends nothing.

It is small and fast. BorderCheck is one file of about 8 MB with nothing else to install, and a full check takes
less than a second on an Apple M5 MacBook. An installed copy does not stay running in the background: the system
starts it once an hour, it does its work and exits.

It is not an antivirus. It does not catch malware; it limits what malware, or a person, can reach. A few of its
findings are strong signs that something hostile is already installed (a startup item that downloads and runs
code, an extension IT has blocked, a crack tool); when it sees one it says so first and, when installed, tells IT
at once ([signs of compromise](docs/policies.md#signs-of-compromise)).

Companies can install it on every laptop, and each one then reports to the IT team on a schedule. See
[For organisations](#for-organisations).

## What it checks

| Check | |
|---|---|
| `firewall` | macOS Application Firewall and stealth mode; Windows Firewall on every profile; on both, an outbound firewall (LuLu on macOS, simplewall on Windows, suggested if missing); ufw, firewalld or nftables/iptables on Linux (live rules need `sudo`) |
| `disk-encryption` | FileVault, BitLocker, LUKS/dm-crypt or ZFS encryption |
| `listeners` | Ports reachable beyond localhost |
| `mesh-vpn` | Private networks (Tailscale, ZeroTier, NetBird, WireGuard, Nebula, Hamachi) do not let their other members in: Tailscale shields up, NetBird "Block inbound connections", no inbound rules in Nebula; ZeroTier, WireGuard and Hamachi have no such switch, so a connected one is a warning |
| `docker` | Containers with ports on 0.0.0.0, host network, privileged, or mounts of `/`, home, credential folders or the Docker socket |
| `secrets` | Keys in shell files and history, `.env` files, private key files and a dozen credential stores (`~/.aws`, Docker, kubeconfig, `.netrc`, gcloud…) |
| `os-updates` | OS version against your minimum, automatic updates on, nothing left waiting; Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave not stale |
| `screen-lock` | A password after sleep, and the screen locks soon enough (Linux: GNOME and KDE only) |
| `remote-access` | SSH server, screen sharing, remote management, RDP and WinRM are off (a guest account is accepted unless the policy says otherwise); remote-control apps (TeamViewer, AnyDesk, RustDesk, Chrome Remote Desktop, Splashtop, ScreenConnect, VNC servers) not running or starting by themselves, and not open to unattended access |
| `ssh-keys` | Private keys without a passphrase or readable by others; who can log in through `authorized_keys` |
| `tunnels` | ngrok, cloudflared, `tailscale funnel`/`serve`, VS Code tunnels, `ssh -R` and others |
| `ai-agents` | Plain-text tokens in MCP and agent configs, and settings that skip approvals or the sandbox |
| `cracked-software` | Traces of cracked Adobe, Autodesk, Windows or Office (blocked licensing servers, KMS emulators, KMSpico); suggests free alternatives |
| `admin-rights` | No passwordless `sudo`; Windows UAC on and asking, built-in Administrator off; if the policy asks, that the daily account is not an administrator |
| `os-protections` | SIP and Gatekeeper (macOS); Defender or another antivirus, tamper protection, SmartScreen, Secure Boot (Windows); Secure Boot, AppArmor or SELinux enforcing (Linux) |
| `sharing` | AirDrop for Everyone, File, Printer, Internet, Media and Bluetooth Sharing, Content Caching (macOS); shared folders, network discovery on public networks, Nearby sharing (Windows); Samba, NFS, CUPS and GNOME file sharing (Linux) |
| `extensions` | Browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox…) and VS Code-family editor extensions on your block list, outside your allow list, or loaded from outside a store |
| `browser-passwords` | Passwords saved in the browser's own password manager, which information stealers take first |
| `trust-store` | Root certificates added to the trust store, and a system proxy, PAC file or proxy variable |
| `package-managers` | npm, pnpm, Yarn, Bun, pip, uv, Go and Cargo settings: registries over plain http, certificate or checksum checks off, every package's install scripts allowed to run |
| `startup-items` | What starts at login or on a schedule (LaunchAgents, autostart, systemd user units, crontab, Run keys, scheduled tasks): download-and-run commands, programs in temporary, download or hidden folders, programs anyone can change |
| `backup` | Time Machine encrypted (and, if the policy asks, set up and recent); Find My Mac or Find my device on |

`os-updates`, `screen-lock` and `remote-access` never go online: they judge what the machine already knows.
Details and options for each: [Policies](docs/policies.md#checks).

## Try it in 30 seconds

Download `bordercheck-<version>-<os>-<arch>` from [Releases](https://github.com/ptrinh/bordercheck/releases/latest)
and run it:

```sh
bordercheck                    # check and print a report
bordercheck -json              # the same report as JSON
bordercheck -only secrets,mesh-vpn
bordercheck -list
```

Exit status: `0` no failures (waived ones do not count), `1` at least one failure, `2` error. A plain run only
reads: it changes nothing and sends nothing. `sudo bordercheck` also shows ports held by system services on
macOS. macOS binaries are signed and notarized; Windows binaries are not Authenticode-signed yet.

## For organisations

Each machine runs BorderCheck every hour as a per-user service and reports to you. Two ways to set that up:

- **The portal** (recommended). Deploy [`receiver/`](receiver), a Cloudflare Worker, on your own account. Give
  each role (Dev, Support, Sales…) a policy, create an invite per person, and send them one command:

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptrinh/bordercheck/main/install.sh | sh -s -- https://bordercheck.domain.com/i/<code>
  ```

  Each machine gets its own token, so you can revoke one alone. The portal shows the fleet, posts alerts to
  Discord or Slack, and can be driven by Claude through its MCP server.
- **A static `policies.json`**, with no portal: host one policy file and your own report endpoint, or keep the
  file beside the binary and only run it by hand.

Above: the invite an employee opens, and the report page a person sees for their own machine.

A policy only needs what it changes:

```json
{ "checks": { "listeners": { "on_problem": "fail" }, "mesh-vpn": { "enabled": false } } }
```

## Privacy and security

- A plain run sends nothing. An installed copy sends a report to the one endpoint in its policy: pass/fail,
  severity, summary and fix per check, plus the email and install ID. Evidence (paths, ports, names) and the
  machine's own IP addresses are sent only if the policy asks. No location is sent.
- Secret values are never printed or sent; at most the last 4 characters of a long provider token.
- An enrolled machine's token goes only to the portal that issued it.
- Updates install only releases whose checksums are signed with the release key, and the update source is
  pinned at install: whoever controls the policy cannot push a binary.
- Reports are self-reported: they tell you who needs help, not proof of compliance.

  upgrading.

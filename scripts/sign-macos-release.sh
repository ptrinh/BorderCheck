# Maintainer only, on a Mac: builds the macOS binaries for a release from the
# tagged commit, signs them with a Developer ID and notarizes them here, where
# the signing key lives, and puts them in a draft GitHub release. It does the
# same for Bordercheck.app, the app bordercheck's macOS notifications come from
# (scripts/build-notifier.sh), which it also staples, and uploads as
# bordercheck-notifier-<tag>-darwin-universal.zip. Pushing the tag afterwards
# starts the release workflow, which takes these from the draft instead of
# building its own, checks them, writes and signs SHA256SUMS over everything,
# and publishes the release.
#
#   scripts/sign-macos-release.sh v1.2.3 [notes-file]
#
#   SIGN_ID         signing identity, e.g. "Developer ID Application: Sample Ltd (ABCDE12345)"
#   NOTARY_PROFILE  notarytool keychain profile (xcrun notarytool store-credentials); only
#                   while the screen is unlocked. Or, for a locked screen too, an App Store
#                   Connect API key: NOTARY_KEY / NOTARY_KEY_ID / NOTARY_ISSUER, or ASC_KEY_PATH /
#                   ASC_KEY_ID / ASC_ISSUER_ID, e.g. after touchenv grant --for 2h ASC_KEY_PATH:
#     touchenv run --intent "release v1.2.3" ASC_KEY_PATH:file -- scripts/sign-macos-release.sh v1.2.3 notes.md
#
# The workflow accepts the binaries only if they were built from exactly the
# tagged commit with a clean tree (and the app only if its Info.plist names
# that commit), so run this on that commit, before pushing the tag.
